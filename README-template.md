## My process

Started with the HTML structure, I quickly noticed the different types of elements that need to be used for this challenge, two different types of lists, <ul> unorganised and <ol> that is organised, also there is a table at the very end, not finished though, I dont know how to make it look like the preview.

Did some variables on the CSS file for the colours for the first time, makes it all really easy.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
